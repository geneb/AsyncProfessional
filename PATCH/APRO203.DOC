          Patching Async Professional version 2.02 to 2.03
          ------------------------------------------------

APR203.EXE is a self-extracting archive that contains patch files to
transform Async Professional version 2.02 into version 2.03. The patch
file was generated using Pocket Soft's .RTPatch utility (version 2.01).

The patch application program PATCH.EXE is required to apply this
patch. You'll find PATCH.EXE in your \APRO\BONUS subdirectory. If you
didn't install the APRO 2.02 bonus files or for some other reason
cannot find PATCH.EXE, you can download it from the same place where
you found APR203.EXE. You'll probably want to keep a copy of PATCH.EXE,
since it can be used to apply all TurboPower maintenance patches.

APR203.EXE contains one patch file, which you should extract or copy
into your \APRO subdirectory. Then move into that subdirectory and
enter the following command at the DOS prompt:

    PATCH APRO203

PATCH provides running status of the patch process, and displays a
summary when patching is complete.

You can delete the patch file (extension .RTP) from your \APRO
directory once patching is complete. You'll probably want to keep
APR203.EXE for a while, in case repatching is required (see below).

As with any TurboPower update, see the READ.ME, READ.1ST, and FASTUPD
files for information about the new version.

Download UPDATE.TXT from the same place where you found APR203.EXE for
additional background information about the patching process, available
patch files, etc.


Be aware of the following limitations of the patching process:
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. The patch only works to bring version 2.02 up to 2.03. We don't
provide patches for major updates (1.XX to 2.XX). You can contact our
sales line (800-333-4160, 719-260-9136) for more information on
purchasing this update.

2. Dependent files that you can rebuild yourself are *not* patched.
This keeps the size of the patch file to a minimum. In many cases, such
patches would be wasted anyway, since there are so many different ways
the dependent files can be created (with varying defines, compiler
options, compiler versions, etc.). Files with the extensions EXE, HLP,
TPU, TPP and DLL are not patched unless they depend on source code or
other files that aren't part of Async Professional. Be sure to remake
all dependent files after you install the patch. All files but the HLP
file can be remade by using the supplied make or project files, or just
by compiling them into your application. The HLP file can be recreated
by entering the following command in the \APRO directory (or wherever
you have stored your APRO help files):

  MAKEHELP /Q APRO

Note in particular that COMTESTO.EXE is not part of the patch. If you
use this program, be sure to recompile it after applying the patch.
This program is made by APROO.MAK. On the other hand, OOPCOM.EXE and
OOPINST.EXE *are* part of the patch, since they depend on Object
Professional.

3. If you didn't originally install all of Async Professional, then
of course PATCH can't update the uninstalled portion of the library.
This isn't a problem unless you later install the rest of the older
version. In that case, you must reuse the patch to bring the newly
installed files up to the current version.

PATCH does not attempt to patch archive (.LZH) files. You must
dearchive all files that you wish to patch. This applies to BONUS
files as well as production files.

4. PATCH can't find files that you have moved out of the \APRO
directory. It *can* find files in subdirectories of this directory,
however.

5. PATCH doesn't attempt to update certain files because they are
updated automatically during installation or when you configure the
library for your application. Because these files have been customized
for your system, PATCH cannot make reliable changes to them. Even so,
it's often important for us to distribute updated versions of these
files, since there may be new defines and dependencies in them. We
decide on a file by file basis whether to distribute a new copy of
these files or to allow your existing version to remain intact. Here is
a list of affected files for APRO 2.02:

  Directory         Filename      In Patch?  New Name or Directory?
  ----------------  ------------  ---------  ----------------------
  \APRO             APDEFINE.INC  New copy   APDEFINE.203
  \APRO             SIMPCOM.DAT   No
  \APRO\OOPCOM      OOPCOM.CFG    No
  \APRO\OOPCOM      OOPCOM.PB     No
  \APRO\TPFAX       TPFAX.PB      No
  \APRO\TPFAX       TPFAX.INI     No
  \APRO\TPFAX       TPFAX.DT      No

When one of these files is distributed as part of the patch, a complete
new copy of it is included, since PATCH probably cannot patch your
modified copy. Where appropriate, the final column of this table shows
the name or directory of the new copy of the file. Be sure to look at
this new file, modify it as appropriate for your environment, and copy
it over the old version before proceeding.

6. If you modified the TurboPower source code, PATCH refuses to apply
changes to the modified files. (It uses a checksum algorithm to assure
that the file it is patching is the intended version.) In this case,
the only way to get a valid set of patched files is to reinstall an
unmodified copy of Async Professional and patch it, then make your
changes to the new version.

7. APRO 2.03 introduces a significant new modem control system,
including a database of 100+ modems. All of the new files for this new
modem control system are placed in the root APRO directory. See
READ.1ST and MODEM2.DOC for more information.

8. APRO.TPH, the help file for the Borland IDE's, is not included with
this patch. Including it would have nearly doubled the size of the
patch file and it changed very little from version 2.02. If you want an
updated version of APRO.TPH, download APROTPH.LZH from the same place
you downloaded APRO.TPH.
